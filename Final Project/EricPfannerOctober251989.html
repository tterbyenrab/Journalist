      <h1>Bush abortion move ‘no surprise’</h1><br/>
      <a>By Eric Pfanner</a>    
      <p>President Bush’s announcement that he would veto a bill providing publicly funded
         abortions for low-income victims of rape and incest came as no surprise to some Nebraska
         pro-life and pro-choice activists.</p>
      
      <p>“In the scheme of things, it was expected,” said Susan Hale, a lobbyist for Omaha-Council
         Bluffs Planned Parenthood. “It doesn’t significantly affect the overall situation.”</p>
      
      <p>The House and Senate passed the bill last week and sent it to the president.  Richard
         Duncan, president of the Rutherford Institute of Nebraska, a pro-life group, said
         bush’s decision is right because it involves welfare money in the form of Medicaid.</p>
      
      <p>Because pro-life and pro-choice supporters disagree on what types of abortion should
         be legal, tax money should not be provided, even in the case of rape and incest victims,
         he said.</p>
      
      <p>Jo Eberly, a coordinator of the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights, said the
         pro-choice movement may gain strength as a result of Bush’s decision.</p>
      
      <p>“Sometimes those seeming reverses give quiet people a voice,” she said.  She said
         the president’s decision was not a setback to the pro-choice movement because abortions
         for rape and incest victims haven’t been funded for eight years.</p>
      
      <p>Julie Lostroh, public relations chairman of the Nebraska Coalition for Life, said
         the group supports Bush’s decision and will continue lobbying in favor of pro-life.</p>
      
      <p>“The battle just started July 3,” she said, with the Supreme Court’s ruling in Webster
         vs. Reproductive Health Services, which opened the door for states to limit abortion
         rights.</p>
      
      <p>Duncan said the  decision gave the pro-life movement new life, and could cause several
         battles over abortion bills in Congress.</p>
      
      <p>“Webster is the real cause why abortion is a front-burner issue,” he said.</p>
      
      <p>Eberly said that although only a small percentage of Americans are active on either
         side of the abortion issue, many have recently become interested in human rights in
         general.</p>
      
      <p>“A lot of people are saying we don’t want to be another South Africa,” she said.</p>
      
      <p>Abortion should not be looked at as a moral issue, but rather as a social one, she
         said. Across-the-board decisions on abortion, she said, don’t give the complete picture.</p>
      
      <p>“Each pregnancy is its own story,” she said.</p>
      
      <p>Eberly said the poor and homeless will most be affected by Bush’s veto.  “It will
         most hurt those without an address; those who can’t be active,” she said.</p>
      
      <p>Before public funds for abortion were cut off eight years ago, she said, 200,000 poor
         women per year received Medicaid money for abortions.</p>
      
      <p>Lostroh said the rape and incest bill would have “opened the door too far” in providing
         public funds.</p>
      
      <p>To be feasible, she said, such a bill would have to require rape or incest victims
         to notify authorities within 72 hours.</p>
      
      <p>The bill does not include a time limit, Lostroh said. As a result, she said, the law
         would have been abused because many pregnant women could have had paid abortions as
         long as they “cried rape.”</p>
      
      <p>Eberly said a time limit for reporting rapes is an unreasonable requirement, because
         many women are afraid to report rapes.</p>
      
      <p>“In many cases, they can hardly admit to themselves that this act has happened,” she
         said.</p>
