      <h1>Speaker: Abortion ‘A Relief’</h1><br/>
      <a>By Bradley C. Rundquist</a>      
      <p>In most cases, having an abortion causes no unusual mental trauma to a woman, according
         to an Arizona State University psychologist.</p>
      
      <p>Nancy Felipe Russo, also the director of Women’s Studies at ASU, told an audience
         of about 300 at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s Wick Alumni Center Monday that
         this conclusion came from a study she participated in earlier this year.</p>
      
      <p>The study, conducted but he American Psychological Association, identified abortion
         as a stressful event, but showed that very few women have problems coping mentally
         after having the operation.</p>
      
      <p>Russo said abortion can cause feeling of regret, anger, doubt, depression, guilt or
         shame.</p>
      
      <p>“But,” she said, “the bad feelings are usually only temporary. In the case of unwanted
         pregnancies, the most common reactions are of happiness and relief.”</p>
      
      <p>Only 12 out of every 10,000 women will need psychological care after having an abortion,
         she said.</p>
      
      <p>Women experiencing one of more risk factors have increased chance for depression or
         other psychological problems, she said.</p>
      
      <p>Factors that may cause depression after aborting pregnancy, according to Russo, are:
         a history of emotional disturbance, terminating a pregnancy that was originally wanted,
         having been recently separated or divorced, waiting longer than three months to have
         the operation and having limited or no social support.</p>
      
      <p>Women are the most mentally disturbed before the operation, she said.  That’s because
         they have been misinformed about abortion in most cases, she said.</p>
      
      <p>Misinformation can also affect a woman’s mental response after the abortion, Russo
         said.</p>
      
      <p>“If they are undermined by myths, it can be very disturbing to women having abortions,”
         she said.</p>
      
      <p>Factual information about the risks and procedure and support from the male partner
         are two factors that can increase a woman’s ability to cope with abortions, she said.</p>
      
      <p>“Help from a woman’s partner in deciding whether or not to have an abortion and support
         from him throughout the process definitely produces a more positive response,” she
         said.  Another study showed that 75 percent of women had an easy time deciding to
         have an abortion and 17 percent said they had difficulty, Russo said.  The remaining
         8 percent had experiences between easy and difficult.</p>
