            <p>Both proponents and opponents at Tuesday’s public hearing on Neligh Sen. John DeCamp’s LB 286 agreed on one thing: they are all against the U.S. Supreme Court decision of Jan. 22 on abortion.</p>
            <p>At the Public Health and Welfare Committee hearing, the West Senate Chamber was filled with witnesses on the hill.</p>
            <p>DeCamp’s bill was necessary after the Supreme Court ruled that states cannot interfere with the right of a woman to have an abortion during the first six months of pregnancy.  The only permissible legislation is to ensure the safe medical standards.</p>
            <p>During the last three months of pregnancy states may interfere.</p>
            <p>DeCamp amended his original bill Tuesday.  The new version provides only medical restrictions.  It forbids abortion by the methods of saline injections and hysterotomies.  DeCamp claimed both these methods are hazardous and are often performed when the fetus is viable.</p>
            <p>An abortion must be performed in hospital conditions.  It requires the written consent of both the father (if known) and the mother of the unborn child.  A minor needs consent of his parents.</p>
            <p>If these obligations are not met, a fine of not less than $20,000 or more than $30,000 can be imposed.  Not less than one year in the Penitentiary or more than 10 years can be imposed.  Both monetary and penal punishments may be imposed simultaneously.</p>
            <p>It is forbidden to mislead a girl into believing she has had an abortion when it hasn’t been done.</p>
            <p>The bill provides for a conscience clause which would permit medical personnel or hospitals to refuse to participate in an abortion.</p>
            <p>It provides a reporting clause, which says that any physician must report data on the abortion to the State Health Department.</p>
            <p>Under the bill, any person desiring an abortion must be informed of possible physical and mental consequences.  The person must also be told of all existing alternatives to the abortion.</p>
            <p>Dr. Robert Messer of the University of Nebraska Medical Center, disagreed with DeCamp’s statement that abortions by saline injection of hysterotomy were hazardous.</p>
            <p>“It seems unwise to eliminate the two safest procedures for abortion,” he said.</p>
            <p>A saline injection involves the withdrawal of 200 milliliters of amniotic solution and the replacement of this solution with 20 per cent saline solution.  This solution kills the fetus, and the mother aborts.</p>
            <p>In a hysterotomy an abdominal incision is made and the uterus is opened.  The fetus and placenta membranes are removed, and the abdomen is closed up.</p>
            <p>Proponents of the bill took the position that no Nebraska law would permit abortion on demand.</p>
            <p>“From a medical and a moral point of view this is a dangerous thing,” DeCamp said.</p>
            <p>Members of the Nebraska Catholic Conference said they are working for the protection of the unborn child by putting as many restrictions as possible under the Supreme Court rulings.</p>
            <p>S.H. Brauer, speaking in opposition to LB 286, said DeCamp’s bill sanctions abortions.  Brauer suggested the Legislature enact a bill forbidding abortion after the first six months.</p>
            <p>When Paul O’Hara, representing the Nebraska Catholic Conference, asked how many people were against the Supreme Court decision, almost the entire audience stood.</p>
            <p>The crowd consisted of about 200 men and women about equally divided on the issue.  Several women with black armbands, Roman Catholic nuns and priests, students and mothers with children were in the audience.</p></div1>
